\Abstract{
The \pkg{rClr} package is a low-level interoperability bridge between R and a Common Language Runtime (CLR), the Microsoft .NET CLR or the Mono implementation. **rClr** is to a CLR the equivalent of what \pkg{rJava} \citep{urbanek:2013} is to a Java runtime. \pkg{rClr} uses the .NET library R.NET.

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
Key messages
Arbitrary .NET code can be executed without modification
Supports more than Windows
Performance considerations

Background: 
used to play with IronPython, C# and R via file transfer. 
rJava and where rClr is similar, but with significant departures in the API.

\section{Usage}

\subsection{rClr}

\subsection{R.NET}

\section{Use cases}
rsqlserver
time stepping simulations systems built on .NET. 
calibrate swift

\section{Limitations}

\section{Internals and architecture}
Mono and .NET: different embedding/hosting APIs
R.NET to the rescue
Memory management and GCs

\section{Future directions}
Less code, more C#, less C/C++
.NET core
Reference classes, perhaps.

\section{Conclusions}
